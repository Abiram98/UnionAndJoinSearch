# Evaluation of Union and Join Search for Semantic Data Discovery
We will implement two simplistic approaches for Wiki union and join search.
We will evaluate these two approaches on a benchmark for semantic data discovery of Wikipedia tables ("<a href="https://github.com/dkw-aau/SemanticTableSearchDataset1~https://github.com/dkw-aau/SemanticTableSearchDataset">A Large Scale Test Corpus for Semantic Table Search</a>") containing automatically constructed ground truth using Wikipedia cateogories.

## Union search
We implement a naive baseline for union search using Wikipedia annotations for similarity union search.
Given an input table, we find unionable tables based on column-centric similarity, i.e., we use a similarity function over table columns to compute an aggregated unionability score per table.
Specifically, we annotate entity cells with their correspoding Wikipedia page categories and represent the table column as the collection of Wikipedia categories of its entity cells.
Then, we measure the Jaccard similarity between pairs of columns between the input table and candidate table.
We apply the Hungarian algorithm to find the best combination of column pairs to maximize the aggregated table score.

## Join Search
We once again implement a naive baseline for join search using Wikipedia annotations for similarity join search.
The aim is to find tables that contains a joinable column with a query column based on overlap of Wikipedia categories of Wikipedia entities in table cells.
This overlap is once again measured with the Jaccard similarity.

For each query-table pair, we find the best pair of columns between the query table and the candidate table that maximize the Jaccard similarity.
This maximum score represents the table score and is used in the final ranking of the tables.

## Experimental Evaluation

### Setup
We evaluate the two baselines against a semanic table search corpus constructed based on Wikipedia tables ("<a href="https://github.com/dkw-aau/SemanticTableSearchDataset1~https://github.com/dkw-aau/SemanticTableSearchDataset">A Large Scale Test Corpus for Semantic Table Search</a>").
We randomly select 12 queries from the corpus tables, and ground truth is automatically extracted through distant supervision.
The table queries consist of DBpedia entities, which we substitute with their corresponding Wikipedia entity through the RDF "isPrimaryTopicOf" relations.
This allows us to annotate the query entities with their corresponding Wikipedia categories.

### Results
We now present the experimental result of the union and join search approaches.
We evaluate union and join search using NDCG, precision, recall, and F1-score for top-10 ranking of tables.
NDCG evalutes the ranking of tables, whereas the remaining evaluate the effectiveness of table retrieval.

The ranking performance is varying, where some queries effectively ranks tables according ot ground truth and therefore achive a perfect performance score, whereas other queries are not able to retrieve and rank any tables at all.
It should be notes that the Wikipedia categories per Wikipedia entity are sparse and very specific.
For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea_at_the_2010_Asian_Games">South Korea at the 2010 Asian Games</a> has the specific categories <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:2010_in_South_Korean_sport">2010 in South Korean sport</a>, <a href="
